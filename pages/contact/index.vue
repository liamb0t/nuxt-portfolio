                Hey I'm Liam. I'm a self-taught programmer with a PPE and BCom (Hons) degree in Economics. 
                I love writing code in Python and building web apps that align with my own personal interests. 
                I spent 4 years living in South Korea. I enjoy watching and playing football (soccer), 
                making music, cooking and playing video games
                in my spare time. My favorite video game of all time is Quake 3/Quakelive.
